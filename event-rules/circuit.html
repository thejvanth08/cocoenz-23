          <b>Event overview</b>
          <p class="para-padding">
            The process of circuit design can cover systems ranging from complex
            electronic systems down to the individual transistors within an
            integrated circuit. One person can often do the design process
            without needing a planned or structured design process for simple
            circuits.
          </p>

            One person can often do the design process without needing a planned
            or structured design process for simple circuits. In integrated
            circuit design automation, the term "circuit design" often refers to
            the step of the design cycle which outputs the schematics of the
            integrated circuit.

            It consists of 2 rounds: <br />
            1.Find and Rectify the Circuit Board Errors as Debugging <br />
            2.Design the circuit in system application with the requirements
            provided
          </p>
          <b>Team Requirements:</b>
          <p>
            1.Each team can consist of a maximum of 2 members. <br />2.Every
            team must have creative and unique team names that reflect the
            spirit of the event. <br />
            3.Participants must have a knowledge on Circuit Designing
